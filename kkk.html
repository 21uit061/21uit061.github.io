<h4>Early electronic computers such as Colossus made use of punched tape, a long strip of paper on which data was represented by a series of holes, a technology now obsolete.[20] Electronic data storage, which is used in modern computers, dates from World War II, when a form of delay-line memory was developed to remove the clutter from radar signals, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line.<br>[21] The first random-access digital storage device was the Williams tube, which was based on a standard cathode ray tube.<br><br><br><image src="E:\website\Large_1984_0535_0001.jpg"></image><br><br><br>However, the information stored in it and delay-line memory was volatile in the fact that it had to be continuously refreshed, and thus was lost once power was removed. The earliest form of non-volatile computer storage was the magnetic drum, invented in 1932[23] and used in the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer.[24]

IBM introduced the first hard disk drive in 1956, as a component of their 305 RAMAC computer system.[25]: 6  Most digital data today is still stored magnetically on hard disks, or optically on media such as CD-ROMs.[26]: 4–5  Until 2002 most information was stored on analog devices, but that year digital storage capacity exceeded analog for the first time. As of 2007, almost 94% of the data stored worldwide was held digitally:[27] 52% on hard disks, 28% on optical devices, and 11% on digital magnetic tape. It has been estimated that the worldwide capacity to store information on electronic devices grew from less than 3 exabytes in 1986 to 295 exabytes in 2007,[28] doubling roughly every 3 years.[29]</h4>
